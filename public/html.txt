    -2. development Server
    -3. Quality Server
    -4. Production Server
-----5. Client Server (Whatever application we build used by user)


1.SandBox Server: - it is a server where repository are kept

2.development server :- here it is build here .

3.Quality server :- here it is check here

4. Production server :- application is used here / apps /Project is already running .


---------------------

Tier and Layers architecture :-

To build a application we need 
 1.Database server
 -Database {kept on different server} database can be Oracle , MySQL ,MongoDB

=========GIT CONCEPT==========

Git is an application which needs to be download and install, which is used to track version.. it is a version control system
https://git-scm.com/downloads
windows>64-bit
after installing check git -v
"https://github.com/prasad-bigdp/angular-11"
Github is just a online code storage like gdrive. u can also use bitbucket,gitlab,aws.

step1:  download git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and install it and check the version by "git -v" in cmd
step2: create github account
step3: go to visual studio code and login into github
step4: setup configs in vscode
git config --global user.email "youremail" 
git config --global user.name "username" 

steps:
1:git init
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "update"
4. git remote add origin "link"
5. git push -u origin main

==========GIT CONCEPT end here==========
